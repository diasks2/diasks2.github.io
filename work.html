            At Sidekick Therapy Partners I led the development of an internal proprietary EMR named "Cue" which includes a full EMR, teletherapy platform, as well as a library of therapy tools therapists can use in their daily sessions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cue helped to streamline operations and enabled Sidekick Therapy Partners to grow from a team ~70 to a team of 180+ in just over 3 years.

            TM-Town is a unique translation platform built around translation memory. TM-Town helps professional translators get the most out of their TMs.

          <p>
            At TM-Town I developed Nakōdo, which was a first-of-its-kind translator search engine wherein someone could upload a sample of the text they needed translated and Nakōdo would match experts for that text based on their prior work and expertise.

            From the transdraft about page:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>"transdraft is a web application for freelance translators that helps improve the translation process and workflow and makes it dead simple to send a beautiful final product to the client. transdraft is software that helps you translate smarter and more efficiently. One of my top priorities in creating transdraft was the user experience. Although transdraft includes many of the same features as other professional translation software tools, I made a concerted effort to hide that complexity in the background. It is my view that software should be frictionless and easy to use.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>A software tool that can do complex things does not need to have a complex and convoluted user experience. At transdraft it is my mission to create translation software you don't need a PhD to use."</em>

            transdraft was acquired by ProZ.com in June 2014
