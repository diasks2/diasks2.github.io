          <p>
            Your speech therapy private practice has a scheduling problem—you just don't know it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're working with therapy clients who have session mandates—whether from IEPs, 504 plans, or other service agreements—you know how crucial it is to meet those required frequencies. But here's the thing: data shows most practices are nowhere close to meeting these mandates.
          </p>

          <p>
            A big component of this issue comes down to scheduling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many therapists schedule sessions as recurring appointments evenly distributed across the month, adopting a "set it and forget it" approach. That means even one absence (and you know that absence is coming) can derail your compliance. For example, 98% of children scheduled for 12 visits per month complete at least 4 visits in that month. In contrast, only 51% of children scheduled for 4 visits per month complete all 4 visits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why the drastic difference?
          </p>

          <p>
            Think about it. Absences happen. A child scheduled for 12 visits per month likely has their 4th visit in the first or second week. However, a child scheduled for only 4 visits per month typically has their 4th visit in the last week. If they are absent, there's little to no time left to make it up.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's where front-loading comes in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of spreading your required visits evenly across the entire month, front-load them. For example, if a client has a frequency of 4 sessions a month, schedule those 4 visits within the first two weeks. This gives you the remaining weeks as a buffer for makeups, cancellations, or unexpected absences. You're being proactive, not reactive.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's a simple shift in scheduling strategy, but the impact on meeting visit mandates, reducing unrealized sessions, and improving overall efficiency can be significant.
          </p>

          <p>
            With better data and an improved scheduling strategy, one practice reduced unrealized visits from 43.3% to <strong>8.7%</strong>.
