            Just listened to <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/unorthodox-pm-wisdom-kevin-yien">Lenny's podcast with Kevin Yien</a>—loved it. Kevin talked about sending an "unsell" email to job candidates, and I'm intrigued to start doing the same at <a href="https://www.ambiki.com/">Ambiki</a>.

          <p>
            Here's ours:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Startups are tough. We'll expect you to be default positive, even when things get messy.
            </li>
            <li>
              We don't care about job titles. If you do, this isn't the position for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trade-offs are constant. You'll need to master the art of saying "no" or "not now."
            </li>
            <li>
              Our team is fully remote, spread across various time zones. That means flexibility is key—you might need to work outside the typical 9-5 at times.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must be humble and ready to listen. Ambiki is a large, complex product. You won't know everything on day one, and that's okay.
            </li>
            <li>
              You need to really enjoy writing. 90% of our communication is written, so clear and thoughtful communication is crucial.
            </li>
            <li>
              You need to embrace the idea that projects are never "done." Features are always evolving, and Ambiki will always be a work in progress. If your sense of accomplishment is tied to finishing things, this may not be the place for you. Here, we focus on shipping and continuous improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              We don't use 3rd party cookies on Ambiki. If you can't imagine doing your job without them, this company isn't for you.
            </li>
          </ul>
