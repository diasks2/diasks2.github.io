          <p>
            I still think about Nakodo. It's one of my favorite things I've ever built, even though it never took off.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name mattered. Nakodo is the Japanese word for matchmaker. That's exactly what it was meant to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the thing about professional translators: the good ones don't just speak two languages. They live inside tiny, specialized slices of expertise. An English–Spanish translator who's spent a decade on automotive manuals can see a phrase and instantly tailor it for mechanics in Mexico City or engineers in Madrid. A Dutch–German legal translator can navigate the subtle gap between <em>Rechtsprechung</em> and <em>jurisprudentie</em> without thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            And yet for smaller jobs outside traditional agencies, there was no reliable way to match work to the right specialist. You could hire a generalist or lose hours searching the internet for someone qualified. It was slow. It was error-prone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nakodo fixed this cleanly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every translator's past work lived in a private vault. Nothing was shared or exposed. When a new job arrived, we analyzed the document and surfaced the translators best suited based on what they'd actually done before. Not resume claims. Demonstrated expertise—identified using natural language processing.
          </p>

          <p>
            You could then additionally filter by customer feedback, years of experience, availability, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the user, it was dead simple: upload a document, and we'll find the right experts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem was real. The solution was elegant.
          </p>

          <h4>The Catch</h4>

          <p>
            Nakodo was a critical-mass feature. It only worked once enough translators had enough past work inside the system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before that threshold, the matches were thin. Upload a semiconductor document and you might get one lukewarm match—or none.
          </p>

          <p>
            It needed network effects to thrive. And network effects don't appear just because you want them to. They require bodies in the room: translators uploading work, clients submitting jobs, enough activity to spark a flywheel.
          </p>

          <p>
            We knew what the flywheel would look like. We just couldn't get it spinning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nakodo didn't necessarily need better design or cleaner code. It needed an ecosystem. And building an ecosystem is a different job entirely. It's slow. It's unglamorous. It asks for patience measured in years, not sprints.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some features pass every validation check and still fail.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not because the problem is imaginary. Not because the solution is weak. But because the conditions for success don't exist yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chat apps with no users. Marketplaces with no buyers or sellers. Matching engines with no data.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I wrote the feature alignment document for Nakodo today, I'd include a new question:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Does this feature require a network effect to function? And if so, how do we reach critical mass?</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It's not enough to solve the right problem. The solution has to land in soil where it can actually grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Solving the problem is only half the job. Creating the conditions where the solution can thrive—that's the harder half.
