          <p>
            During my college years, I served at a restaurant named Lucky 32 in Winston-Salem (which, I've heard, has since closed).
          </p>

          <p>
            I'll never forget the first time I attempted to serve wine. My nerves got the better of me, leading to a deep cut on my finger from the metal wrapper, with blood dripping everywhere. It was a mortifying experience, and I was determined to never open another wine bottle again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enter my roommate: not just my colleague and carpool buddy but a budding entrepreneur and capitalist. He spotted an opportunity and offered to handle wine service for my tables for a small fee. I'm a bit foggy on the exact amount (a couple dollars I think), but without hesitation, I accepted.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was meticulous about tracking my work details - tables served, tips earned - you name it, I recorded it in Excel. So, the data was clear when things began to change.
          </p>

          <p>
            As my roommate took over wine duties, patrons assumed they were being treated by a wine sommelier, elevating their dining experience at our quasi-upscale establishment. The tips surged. Not only did the increase cover the fee I owed my roommate, but I also pocketed a tidy profit.
          </p>

          <p>
            The outcome? A win-win-win:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>My roommate earned extra cash.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed bigger tips.</li>
            <li>Our guests received a seemingly luxurious dining experience.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            What's the lesson?
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Adaptability is key: Instead of being bogged down by an initial failure, it's essential to find alternative solutions and adapt to the situation.</li>
            <li>Life (and business) isn't a zero sum game: One person's success doesn't necessarily mean another's loss.</li>
            <li>Perception is powerful: The way something is presented or perceived can drastically alter its value in the eyes of others.</li>
            <li>Track and learn: By keeping detailed records and studying the data, one can identify patterns, opportunities, and areas of improvement.</li>
