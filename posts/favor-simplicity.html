            Our second value: <strong>“Favor simplicity”</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Three months into my role at Curlee Communications (now Sidekick Therapy Partners), a sudden departure left me in charge of the colossal task of monthly billing for the Tennessee Early Intervention System (TEIS). Why? I was the one "good with spreadsheets."
          </p>

          <p>
            That first month, the task took me over two weeks, working much more than 40 hours each week. By the time I finished it was already time to start the next month's memorandum. At this point it was bordering on absurd; this would be my full-time job unless I found a way to automate it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what the process looked like:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Verify Patient Sessions</strong>: Manually cross-check each patient on the TEIS spreadsheet (which we had to update as new patients started or billing situations changed) with Curlee's then-current EMR system (which will remain nameless) for any sessions they had during the month.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Entry</strong>: Manually enter each session's details into Excel – from location to duration to then hand calculating what TEIS owed us based on a confusing set of rules (all of this often required sifting through the sluggish EMR software where pages took over 10 seconds to load).</li>
            <li><strong>Compile Explanation of Benefits (EOBs)</strong>: Every line item needed its corresponding EOBs. Some patients had claims with multiple insurance companies. We had to print each EOB, highlight the date of service and payment amount <em>in yellow</em>, then scan it back into the computer. Picture doing this for hundreds of sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Package It Up</strong>: All of this had to culminate into one neat PDF. Three invoices from three Excel tabs, with all EOBs in the precise order.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Sounds nightmarish, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            Automating the process posed its challenges:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The EMR software Curlee used lacked a link between the treatment, invoice, and EOB.</li>
            <li>The new EMR we were building (which would later be named 'Cue') was still embryonic, it hadn’t even earned a title as an EMR yet. This would actually be the first "feature".</li>
            <li>Exporting data out of the EMR software Curlee was using was no simple task.</li>
            <li>We also needed ways for calculating TEIS eligibility, identifying TEIS patients, and automating the EOB highlighting process.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Well, I was determined I would only suffer doing that manually one time. A few weeks after navigating that tedious manual process, I emailed out a video, 1:42 minutes long, showcasing the new TEIS process automation. My voiceover began, “What used to take hours and a few people should now take less than the length of this video”.
          </p>

           <p>
            And indeed, the process was distilled to: “Enter start date”, “Enter end date”, click “Generate invoice”, and print to PDF.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was proud, it felt like a mic drop moment. Simplicity for our users often means fighting through a lot of blood, sweat, tears, and complexity to get there. But that is the core of our value "Favor simplicity"; we do the hard work so that our solutions are intentionally simple.
