          <p>
            Sunday afternoon at Motegi theme park in Tochigi.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was alone with my three kids, waiting in line for the Dekoboko, an off-road buggy ride they had all pointed to on the map when I asked what they wanted to do. Twenty minutes in, we were almost at the front.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then an announcement came over the speakers: children under third grade must ride with one adult per child.
          </p>

          <p>
            My stomach dropped.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Japan, a rule is a rule. I started rehearsing how to explain to three kids that we'd waited for nothing. Or worse, one gets to go but the others don't.
          </p>

          <p>
            But when we reached the front, the staff didn't shrug and point to the sign.
          </p>

          <p>
            They paused. Looked at our group. And offered a solution: my oldest could drive on his own. I'd ride with one of the younger kids, then switch and ride again immediately with the other.
          </p>

          <p>
            No extra wait. No hassle.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would've been so easy to enforce the rule and move on. Most places would have.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead, one staff member took five seconds to think about the situation in front of them rather than the policy behind them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nothing broke. No exception spiraled out of control. Three kids left smiling.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was a tiny decision. And it's the one part of the day I've already retold three times.
