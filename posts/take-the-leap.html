          <p>
            In my career, I’ve sometimes observed a stalemate between employee and company.
          </p>

          <p>
            The employee's mindset: "I won't overextend or go above and beyond <strong>until</strong> I receive a raise or promotion."
          </p>

          <p>
            The company's mindset: "We won't offer a raise or promotion <strong>until</strong> we see this employee show potential that they can step beyond their current role."
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ll call it the “UNTIL impasse”.
          </p>

          <p>
            My advice, though it might go against the grain, is for employees to take that leap, given two considerations:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>By doing so, you'll acquire a new skill or evolve personally.</li>
            <li>You initiate a conversation about your aspirations. (Never just assume they notice all the work you're putting in.)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            If you act on the above, three potential outcomes emerge:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>You secure the desired raise or promotion, charting a growth trajectory within your company.</li>
            <li>While you might not receive the raise or promotion immediately, the conversation has begun, and you've been given clear guidelines for reaching that goal.</li>
            <li>It becomes evident that the promotion or raise is unlikely, signaling that it's time to search for employers who will appreciate your talents.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            While at AEON, I invested nights and weekends crafting a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19iZn3pwTJPQkUpv8etNHYmvr0GK9hA6L/view?pli=1">Student Database</a> in both English and Japanese. This enabled employees to monitor student progression more effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            I presented this to spark a discussion about possibly transitioning from teaching to a technological role within the company. Though I wasn't expecting full adoption of my solution, I aimed to showcase my drive and abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their response? "Foreigners are primarily English teachers here, but with time, they might become trainers." That was the moment I contemplated my next career move.
          </p>

          <p>
            A similar episode unfolded at SEI. I dedicated my off-hours to develop a web application to streamline school management, bolster teacher-parent communication, and track student progress. I used this as a stepping stone to inquire about roles beyond being an ESL teacher. Their silent answer was loud and clear. Time for a new job.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite the disappointment from these experiences, both projects equipped me with skills that later proved integral to landing a better position.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other side of the coin, taking the leap at ProZ.com, Sidekick Therapy Partners, and <a href="https://ambiki.com/">Ambiki</a> was rewarded with greater autonomy, trust, and career progression.
          </p>

          <p>
            Take that leap. If you are waiting for the company to make the first move, you may find yourself waiting longer than anticipated.
