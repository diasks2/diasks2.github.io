          <p>
            I invented <a href="../inventions.html#cooperation_cube">Cooperation Cube</a> on a flight from Tokyo to Syracuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I think back to that flight, three key ingredients stand out that I believe can be generalized for anyone trying to invent something new:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Have a High-Level Concept</li>
            <li>Articulate Your Taste (What Do You Like?)</li>
            <li>Put Yourself in a New Environment</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Have a High-Level Concept</strong></p>

          <p>
            I knew I wanted to create a "3D board game" - something physical, not just a flat board, and not merely an RPG or tabletop game with miniature characters.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you don't have a high level concept, it's like playing charades without an initial word to act upon.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Articulate Your Taste (What Do You Like?)</strong></p>

          <p>
            There were elements and game mechanics I appreciated about the games I had played in the past:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hearts</strong>: I liked that you could "shoot the moon". What might seem like a stroke of luck, going from last to first right at the end, is often well-thought-out strategy from start to finish.</li>

            <li><strong>Catan</strong>: I appreciated the high level of interaction between players through trading and cooperation.</li>

            <li><strong>Mafia</strong>: The elements of trust and deceit provided an interesting dynamic.</li>

            <li><strong>Dominion</strong>: I enjoyed that there wasnâ€™t just one path or strategy to victory, offering various approaches to explore.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Having this list of ingredients in mind provided me with a starting point, a puzzle to solve, intertwining these favored mechanics into a new, cohesive gameplay experience.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Put Yourself in a New Environment</strong></p>

          </p>
            It's vital to stimulate your senses with something new - a new place, sounds, and smells. However, it's not only about introducing new scenery. The environment also needs to be conducive to focus, enabling you to be alone and distraction-free so you can enter a state of deep concentration. For me, 13 hours alone on a flight did the trick.
