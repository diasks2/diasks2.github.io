          <p>
            I'm excited to share with you my latest project - a software system called <a href="https://ambiki.com/emr/tenalog">Tenalog<sup>®</sup></a>, specifically designed to aid speech language pathologists (SLPs) in writing their notes efficiently and improving patient progress tracking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Around 4.5 years ago, I set out to develop a solution that would help SLPs extract structured data from their patient notes to track patient progress over time. The initial version of this software, a visit note editor, included advanced keyboard shortcuts to streamline this process. Though it was a significant step forward in data collection and progress tracking, the steep learning curve for the keyboard shortcuts and the conventions posed an initial challenge to our users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspired by this feedback, I moved to the next iteration where I incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically extract structured data. This change dramatically alleviated the burden on the therapists, cutting down the time it took to write a comprehensive note and further enhancing the ease of progress tracking. However, I still felt there was more to be done.
          </p>

          <p>
            A question that continued to linger in my mind was: what if the note could write itself? What if the SLP could dedicate 100% of their attention to their patient during the session? Personally, I struggle with multitasking, so I wanted to devise a solution that would allow individuals like me to be entirely present in the session, without the background stress of trying to remember the details of the ongoing proceedings.
          </p>

          <p>
            This line of thinking led to the creation of Tenalog<sup>®</sup> (tenacious logging). To utilize Tenalog<sup>®</sup>, all the therapist needs to do is record the session. Tenalog<sup>®</sup> then auto-generates a complete transcript with speaker labels, a visit note, detailed progress tracking data, a parent summary, the next session's plan, as well as links to evidence-based practice references relevant to the patient's current goals.
