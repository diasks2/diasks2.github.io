            I've been thinking about this and I'm curious what others call it, especially in B2B SaaS.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have a churn goal this year, and I realized my mental model of "churn" might be different from some of my teammates'.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my head, churn meant customers who'd been with us for a few months, were live, paying, actively using the product, and then left. The kind of churn where you start asking hard questions about support quality, product gaps, and relationship management.
          </p>

          <p>
            Others were also counting customers who never really got off the ground. They left during implementation, churned before their first invoice, or shortly thereafter. That raises very different questions: was there a mismatch between the marketing message and reality? An expectation-setting issue in sales? A miss in how the product was configured for their needs?
          </p>

          <p>
            These feel like fundamentally different problems, with different root causes and different owners. One is a retention problem. The other is an onboarding or activation problem, or possibly a sales-fit problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I'm not sure we have clean, shared industry language for this. "Early churn" vs. "mature churn"? "Onboarding churn" vs. "retention churn"?
          </p>

          <p>
            Curious how others handle this. Do you have standard definitions, or does every company just draw its own line? Or does everything get lumped into one big "churn" bucket?
          </p>

          <p>
            What do you call these in your org?
