          <p>
            For speech therapy practices, contract details matter. Contracts with your therapists. Contracts with the school systems you serve.
          </p>

          <p>
            But do these details really matter? At first glance, meticulously negotiating each minor detail might appear as a route to heightened profits. But what's the hidden cost?
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider this: Implementing varied mileage rates for therapists traveling to different schools seems like a smart move, doesn't it? In reality, it's cumbersome. The effort spent in calculating these diverse rates consumes more staff hours and more resources. The actual savings? Negligible.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the surface, it might seem that paying therapists varied rates based on the insurance payer of the session better aligns your income and expenses. Surely, a single average rate would be too perilous, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            The real risk lies in the lost productivity, opportunity costs, and other detrimental impacts arising from this complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The unseen threats to your profitability include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Continuous staff engagement in managing this intricate system.</li>
            <li>Employee burnout due to administrative work they don't enjoy.</li>
            <li>Rising attrition rates as competitors provide roles free from these encumbrances.</li>
            <li>The opportunity cost of prioritizing yet another spreadsheet.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every hour spent on managing and invoicing these contracts is an hour not invested in growth. So, why not opt for simplicity? A uniform rate for all services—straightforward and requiring minimal administrative effort.
          </p>

          <p>
            A transparent, uncomplicated structure trumps a complex one. Even if it means occasionally forgoing a few cents, the overall benefits will surpass the minor losses.
          </p>

          <p>
            While you might have an amazing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system that is built to handle such complexity (like <a href="https://ambiki.com/">Ambiki</a>), it will still introduce hidden overhead on your business.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bottom line? Success doesn't hinge on the minutiae. It thrives on simplicity. In contracts, less is often more.
