            Our foremost value: <strong>“Be ambitious”</strong>.

            Development of our teletherapy platform began as a skunkworks project on February 8th, 2020, spurred by the initial coronavirus cases from China.
          </p>

          <p>
            In late February 2020, when Japan made the monumental decision to close schools, I reached out to senior leaders on our team, hoping to secure their support in focusing full-time resources on the teletherapy platform—anticipating similar school closures in the US.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their response? A skeptical <a href="https://youtu.be/LoOXKha7uL4?feature=shared">Dwyane Wade-esque fake cough</a> and doubts about US schools ever closing. However, regardless, they trusted my judgment and granted me complete autonomy over the tech roadmap.

            March 12th, 2020 became a landmark day. Not only was my son born, but the first school district in Tennessee announced that schools would be closing the next day.

            Our teletherapy platform was already live, having completed its maiden session on March 2nd. Remarkably, in those few short weeks, we didn’t just launch a functional teletherapy platform, but also achieved significant buy-in from our therapist team.

            In a survey conducted a few months prior, 59 out of 60 therapists had no teletherapy experience and showed no inclination towards it. However, after the initial US school closures, I initiated daily "Coffee with Kevin" sessions, inviting therapists to join me on early-morning video calls. They shared feedback and desired improvements, while I updated them on changes made over the previous 24 hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            That platform went on to serve almost 1,000,000 minutes of therapy for Sidekick in that first year alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I contemplate what it truly means to "be ambitious," I believe a certain level of naivety is essential. If one always grasped the full scale of challenges, one might never take that important first step.
