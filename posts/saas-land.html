          <p>
            On the faraway hill of SaaS-land, they say,<br>
            A platform was built, bright as the day.<br>
            It started for speech, to help those in need,<br>
            But soon shifted focus, all driven by greed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mental health, they shouted, is where money's at!<br>
            So they turned their back on the speech folks—just like that!<br>
            The speech therapists clamored, "What about us?"<br>
            But the platform just grew, without any fuss.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ignored and forgotten, their voices grew small,<br>
            As the app kept on rising, to profit’s big call.<br>
            But down on the ground, in the speech therapist crowd,<br>
            A company named Ambiki stood tall and proud.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We hear you," they said, "and we understand,<br>
            Your work is important, your needs must be planned!"<br>
            With care and precision, they built it anew,<br>
            Focused on speech, and on helping YOU!
          </p>

          <p>
            So, the moral, dear friends, is crystal and clear,<br>
            Ambiki is here, with nothing to fear.<br>
            They won't stray from the path, they know what's true—<br>
            Supporting speech therapists, and supporting YOU!
