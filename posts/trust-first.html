          <p>
            For almost two years at <a href="https://ambiki.com/">Ambiki</a>, I've been trying to get each area of the business to share KPI updates in a weekly meeting.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'd talk about it. Agree it was a good idea. Then it would quietly fall apart for one reason or another.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last week, it finally happened. And it was… awesome.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking back, the missing ingredient wasn't process, templates, or reminders.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trust that this wasn't accountability theater.<br>
            Trust that no one was going to point at a number and say, "Explain yourself."<br>
            Trust that saying "we tried this and it didn't work" wouldn't be punished.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because in a small startup, everything is tangled together. KPIs don't really belong to silos, even if we report them that way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The real value wasn't the numbers themselves. It was the shared context. Faster learning. The ability to connect dots across teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm more excited about this year at Ambiki than I've been in a while.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not because the numbers are suddenly perfect, but because we finally have a safe place to look at them together.
