            We're embarking on a new experiment at Ambiki. As a software development company, collaboration is paramount to our success. However, the ability to engage in deep, focused work is equally crucial. This initiative aims to strike a balance, ensuring we allocate adequate time for both.

              "Hey team, I've been thinking about how we can give teammates more chances to get into a flow state. Teamwork and collaboration are extremely important to what we do, but sometimes we also need a chance to retreat to a metaphorical cabin in the woods.

              The idea is called <strong>Zen Zone Days</strong>. These are 7 days spread throughout the year where you can go 'offline' from meetings, Teams, and client responsibilities (the only restriction being you can't use them on back-to-back days). You are "OOO" to the rest of the team and external parties.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
              You're still working, but the idea is to give you uninterrupted time to really dig deep into tasks and projects. It's a chance to get into a flow state without the usual distractions. I believe this could help us all feel more productive and less stressed. Let me know your thoughts/questions/comments."
