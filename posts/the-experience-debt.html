            Companies are replacing junior roles with AI. They're not hiring grads. They're cutting the "learning" positions because, well, Claude or ChatGPT or Gemini can do the work faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the short term, the math probably works. Fewer salaries. Faster output. Leaner teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what I keep coming back to:
          </p>

          <p>
            Where does the next generation of senior engineers come from? Of product leaders? Of the people who'll be making the hard calls in ten years?
          </p>

          <p>
            It's not just cutting costs. It's cutting the pipeline.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think about my own path. The mistakes I made that taught me what no AI could have. The slow accumulation of judgment that only comes from years of context, consequence, and correction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Are we betting that AI will be good enough by then that none of this matters? That we won't need human judgment at the top because there won't be a top? That judgment, context, and experience become optional because the system itself replaces them.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn't about one company cutting costs or skipping junior hires. It's about what happens when an entire ecosystem stops training its future decision-makers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reckoning won't come this year. Maybe not next year either.
          </p>

          <p>
            But gaps have a way of showing up exactly when you need the thing you stopped investing in.
